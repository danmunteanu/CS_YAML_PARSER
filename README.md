# C# Yaml Parser

This is a simple YAML parser implementation written in C#.

I've also created a companion course explaining how I developed it the app.

The course is good for C# beginners and early intermediate.

It can help them grow more confident in their C# and OOP skills.

The course is available for purchase on Udemy, link below:

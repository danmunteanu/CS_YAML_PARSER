# C# Yaml Parser

This is a simple YAML parser implementation I've written in C#.

I've also created a companion course explaining how to develo the app.

It's good for C# beginners and early intermediate.

It can help them grow more confident in their C# and OOP skills.

The course is available on Udemy, link below:
